# Overview
This module is intended to provide a generic renderer from RakuDoc v2 into text, but is designed to be easily extended to other output formats by subclassing.

Two other formats, namely HTML and MarkDown, are provided in the distribution.

The two main documentation sources are:

*  [An overview of the generic renderer](/Render.md)

*  [The templating system](/Templates.md)

Other modules are also documented:



*  [Processed - objects to keep track of intermediate state](/Processed.md)

*  [PStr - Strings containing forward references](/PromiseStrings.md)

*  [ScopeData - an object to keep track of data valid for a block scope](ScopeData - an object to keep track of data valid for a block scope.md)

*  [a table of the minimum set of templates to render any RakuDoc source](/default-text-templates.md)

*  [a grammar for parsing the meta data of a Markup code](/MarkUpMeta.md)

*  [an object for numerating items headings](/Numeration.md)
